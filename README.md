# Data Portfolio: Healthcare Dataset Dashboard

## Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the financial performance of a healthcare center and provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of its healthcare providers. By examining key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the center's financial health and identify areas for potential improvement.

## Executive Summary
This analysis was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the healthcare center's financial performance and provider insights. By examining key metrics such as billing amounts, medication costs, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket expenses, we identified key trends and areas for potential improvement. A key insight from the analysis is that Cardiology consistently emerged as the department with the highest overall billing amount, while Pediatrics had the lowest (see Analysis of Financial Performance by Department)1. Based on the analysis, we recommend focusing on optimizing resource allocation and service delivery in high-revenue departments like Cardiology, while exploring strategies to improve efficiency and potentially increase revenue in lower-performing departments like Pediatrics. By implementing these recommendations, the healthcare center can potentially increase revenue by 5-10% and improve overall financial performance (see Potential Impact of Recommendations).

## Methodology
### Data Sources
The primary data source for this analysis is a healthcare dataset comprising 8 tables:
-	Visits: Contains detailed information on patient visits, including date, patient ID, provider ID, department ID, diagnosis, procedure, insurance, service type, costs, and patient satisfaction.
-	Providers: Provides information on healthcare providers, including name, gender, nationality, and age.
-	Procedures: Lists the different medical procedures performed at the center.
-	Patients: Contains demographic information on patients, including gender, age, city, and race.
-	Insurance: Lists the insurance providers used by patients.
-	Diagnosis: Lists the different diagnoses made at the center.
-	Departments: Lists the various departments within the healthcare center.
-	Cities: Provides a list of cities and states where patients reside.

### Tools Used
The following tools were used for data analysis and visualization:
-	Microsoft Excel – Data familiarization and exploration
-	Microsoft PowerBI – Data visualization

### Data Exploration
Initial data exploration involved familiarizing ourselves with the dataset and identifying key variables. This included examining the distribution of billing amounts, medication costs, and treatment costs across different departments, procedures, and patient demographics.

### Data Analysis Techniques
The following data analysis techniques were employed:
-	KPI Analysis: We calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total billing amount, average billing amount per visit, total medication cost, average medication cost, total treatment cost, average treatment cost, total insurance coverage, average insurance coverage, total out-of-pocket expenses, and average out-of-pocket expenses. This involved aggregating data from the Visits table and calculating relevant metrics to assess the financial performance of the healthcare center.
-	Trend Analysis: We analyzed trends in billing amounts and patient visits over time, specifically by month of the year. This involved aggregating data by month and visualizing the trends to identify any seasonal patterns or significant fluctuations in financial performance.
-	Comparative Analysis: We compared financial performance and patient demographics across different categories such as gender, race, diagnosis, and city. This involved grouping data by these categories and calculating relevant KPIs to identify any disparities or significant differences in healthcare utilization and costs.
-	Diagnostic Analysis: This analysis was used to identify the root cause of the low billing amount in October. By examining various factors such as patient demographics, diagnoses, and service types, we aimed to understand the underlying reasons for the low financial performance in that specific month1.

## Future Considerations for Data Analysis
In the future, we can leverage additional data analysis techniques to further refine our understanding of the healthcare center's performance and identify areas for improvement. These techniques include:
-	Predictive Modeling: This technique can be used to forecast future patient volumes, predict potential revenue, and optimize resource allocation. By building statistical models based on historical data and relevant factors, we can anticipate future trends and make proactive decisions to improve efficiency and financial performance.
-	Segmentation Analysis: This method involves dividing patients into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, healthcare needs, or behavioral patterns. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of different patient segments, we can tailor services, improve patient satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.

### Analysis of Financial Performance by Service Type
Outpatient service type had the highest percentage of total billing between emergency and inpatient in every diagnosis. Inpatient service type had the lowest percentage of total billing between emergency and outpatient for every diagnosis category except for hypertension and appendicitis, where emergency had the lowest total billing amount. This suggests that outpatient services are a major source of revenue for the healthcare center, while inpatient services may require further examination to optimize resource allocation and potentially increase revenue.

### Analysis of Financial Performance by Month
January had the highest total billing with $852.14k (avg. $689.99), while October had the lowest billing with $29.20k (avg. $648.82) due to a low number of patients. This highlights a potential seasonal trend in healthcare utilization and revenue generation. Further investigation is needed to understand the factors contributing to the low patient volume in October and explore strategies to potentially increase revenue during that month.
